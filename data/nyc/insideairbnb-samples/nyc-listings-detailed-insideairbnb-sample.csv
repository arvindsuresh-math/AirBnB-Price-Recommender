WHY WILLIAMSBURG?

Williamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself.

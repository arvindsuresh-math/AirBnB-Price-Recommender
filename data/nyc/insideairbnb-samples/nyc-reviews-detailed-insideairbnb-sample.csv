The street is pleasant, tree-lined and quiet and the townhouse is located a short, convenient walk from the F train, which has been perfect for getting to my office here.<br/>It's easy to see why John's a Super Host and I look forward to staying with him again!"
2539,194787986,2017-09-17,149989346,Amy,John was a great host. He was very responsive before and during our visit. He really wanted to make sure we had a good stay. It was our 1st Airbnb experience and wasn't sure what to expect. Was happy to find street parking in a safe neighborhood.
2539,292241108,2018-07-17,64678596,Dahn,"Clean, quiet, well-run home, very close to the subway"
2539,338504734,2018-10-19,3560397,Cem,John was always responsive during my stay. He answers back immediately when you request something from him. The neighborhood is very calm and secure. The rooms are clean and John does his best to make comfortable your stay. It takes approximately 45 minutes by subway to reach Manhattan mid-town and the house is located one block to the subway station. I recommend John's place.

C'est idéal pour une famille de 3 ou 4 personnes.<br/>Petits soucis en arrivant il y avait personne pour nous recevoir, et il manquait le savon pour la douche, le liquide vaisselle, nous les avons reçu de surlendemain. Il y a aussi le bruit du Métro de NY, donc une première nuit difficile si on est pas habitué. Jennifer est correcte le remboursement de la caution était très rapide.  A part ces petits détails notre court séjour c'est bien passé. <br/>Si j'ai la possibilité de revenir sur NY pour les vacances, je reprendrai à ""The Midtown Castle""<br/>Jean<br/>Possession - Ile de La Réunion<br/>"

2595,46312,2010-05-25,117113,Alicia,We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle!
2595,1238204,2012-05-07,1783688,Sergey,"Hi to everyone!<br/>Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best.<br/>The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown!"
2595,1293632,2012-05-17,1870771,Loïc,"Jennifer was very friendly and helpful, and her place is exactly as advertised. The location is very convenient, and it was a pleasure to stay at the Midtown Castle. I definitely recommend it :)<br/><br/>Thanks !"

19812,28630,2010-03-07,26080,Dmitriy,"Responsible, responsive and altogether great person to deal with. Spacious homey place in the heart of Williamsburg, quiet yet full of local flavor and close to anything you'd ever need in the vicinity. Highly recommended."
19812,31180,2010-03-24,75771,Verena,Cute small apartment in top location! The area is amazing - lots of cafés and nice little shops. We also felt very safe. The apartment is individually furnished and we enjoyed all the little arty details! Our bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed although it could have been a little bit cleaner. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends.
19812,32510,2010-03-31,86716,Dana,"amazing apt in the best location.<br/>we stayed there for a week and it felt so homey and comfterble.<br/>had the best time <br/>tnx alot<br/>d&d "
19812,32944,2010-04-03,85199,Adrienne,"Starlee's darling apartment is exactly as described, only just a little bit more so.  It is even more sunny; the kitchen and living room are just a little more roomier; and the neighborhood is even more fantastic.  As the reviews of Starlee share, she is responsive and helpful.  Would def stay here again! "
19812,36298,2010-04-18,51596,Jessica,"We had a lovely time staying at Starlee's apartment. We felt very safe and the apartment is light and the living areas spacious. <br/><br/>Williamsburg is very cool and we had no shortage of great places to eat and 24/7 supermarkets etc. The subway is very close and is it probably quicker to get into the centre of Manhattan from Bedford Av than places way up town. <br/><br/>Starless was a pleasure to deal with and always quick to respond. We would recommend her apartment to friends and would love to come back! "

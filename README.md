# Airbnb Deep Learning Project

This project explores applications of deep learning and big data tools to Airbnb listing and review datasets. The goal is to build a portfolio-grade machine learning pipeline that integrates large-scale data processing, model training, and deployment.

## Project Objectives

- Work with large-scale, messy datasets using SQL and PySpark
- Develop a useful deep learning model or application
- Deploy the model on AWS (S3, SageMaker)
- Deliver insights aligned with real stakeholder needs

## Data Sources

- AirROI: listing, availability, pricing, and reviews data via API and bulk downloads
- InsideAirbnb (optional): similar structure, may be used for cross-validation

## Technologies

- Data processing: SQL, PySpark, Pandas
- Modeling: PyTorch, scikit-learn
- Deployment: AWS S3, SageMaker
- Development: Conda, JupyterLab, Git, GitHub

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for instructions on installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and contributing to the project.

## Team

The primary goal is to create a highly interpretable model that explains *why* a listing has a certain price relative to its local market.\n","\n","The model is architected as a series of parallel sub-networks, each specializing in a different aspect of a listing: location, size, quality, amenities, description, and seasonality. Instead of predicting the absolute price, this model predicts the listing's price **deviation** from the average price in its neighborhood. This is a multiplicative model, where each sub-network learns a factor that scales the price up or down based on its features. The final layers of the text embedding models are fine-tuned to adapt their representations for this specific price prediction task."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HsycryAjeJbg"},"source":["#### **0.
